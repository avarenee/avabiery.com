		<h2>About me</h2>
    <img height="400px" width="300px" src="assets/ava.png">
    <p>Born and raised in rural Ohio, I moved to Middletown, Connecticut to study my first and most enduring love: Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've shared this love with my community by tutoring Middletown public school children,
      as well as by working for Wesleyan's Mathematics and Computer Science department as a tutor and course assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a passion for libraries, and have worked as a circulation assistant for Olin Library, as well as assisted in program development
      with <a href="https://russelllibrary.org/">Russell Library</a> during my semester as Community Service Chair for my chapter of the
      <a href="http://www.adps.org/">Alpha Delta Phi</a> literary society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a number of creative interests, including theater and writing.
      In 2018, I performed the role of Emily in a Wesleyan student production of the 2013 play Disgraced by Ayad Akhtar.
      For the four years I attended Wesleyan, I co-organized and performed in a production called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WESEQUE/">ESQUE</a>, a student showcase founded to uplift
      the creative voices of marginalized students. I write poetry and short stories in my free time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm working on my development portfolio. Recent projects of mine include RESP, a progressive web app for use in natural
      disaster relief, and MetaCleanup, a Python command-line tool to fix music library metadata. More about these projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>. I'm also actively submitting
      my poetry to literary magazines. Excerpts of my writings can be found <a href="poetry.html">here</a>.
