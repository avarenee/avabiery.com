		<h2>Poetry</h2>
    <p>My work gravitates towards themes of rural life, nature, grief, trauma, and gender. My writing influences include Ilya Kaminsky, Jungmin Yoon, Agha Shahid Ali,
      Michael Chabon, Jericho Brown, Jamie Stewart, Phil Elverum, Sufjan Stevens, Joanna Newsom, and countless other writers, poets, and lyricists.
      Note that in order to avoid my work from being disqualified on submission to certain magazines, I will only feature work on this page I don't intend
      to publish.</p>

          <h2>Smallness Visited</h2>
          <p>
             For most of life<br>
             How I lived, what I did, was meaningless<br>
             I grew up nowhere. I did nothing<br>
             Most of my hours were spent in a room with a screen of some kind<br>
             And the reprieve from this was to explore my backyard<br>
             For my backyard was the woods, and the quarry, and the Vermilion river<br>
             This was my event in an eventless life<br><br>
             But whenever I needed that – an event<br>
             (I didn’t realize at the time, but)<br>
             It played out as best as it could<br>
             Lucky, so lucky, I’ve always been so lucky<br>
             I get lost. I find the river. I follow it home<br>
             I hear noises. I’m scared. I follow the Vermilion river<br>
             It leads home. The noises fade. They don’t follow. They don’t reach<br><br>
             When I was in high school, a man from the trailer park next to my house<br>
             Was arrested after threatening violence on someone<br>
             He claimed to be a werewolf. They found multiple guns and knives in his trailer<br>
             Check my arms. There are no bite marks from this lycanthrope<br><br>
             You don’t recognize it as luck<br>
             Until you find people who didn’t have it<br>
             Whose events were meant to be strolls in the woods<br>
             And turned into mauling by wolves<br><br>
             In middle school, I joined the swim team<br>
             And bemoaned that decision every so often<br>
             I dive into the pool, and the water is cold<br>
             But the water is safe. How could I complain?

          <h2>I Will Show You How to Garden</h2>
          <p>
            I have tended to this garden<br>
            For some time now<br>
            And it still feels funny when the ants crawl<br>
            Into the insides of my gloves<br>
            When the prickle of weeds scratches my wrists<br>
            I spray pesticide and preserve the Spring<br>
            The way it blooms<br><br>
            Like the flowers wild and red<br>
            I was wild and red, and I held<br>
            A Jerusalem cricket in my hand<br>
            It was a double misnomer<br>
            The wrong bug from the wrong country<br>
            I am a misnomer, but then so is my lover<br>
            I suppose that isn’t so rare<br><br>

            My trowel strikes at the dry summer Earth<br>
            Packed and impenetrable<br>
            But there is a home to be dug here<br>
            For new fragrant and admirable life<br>
            How the season resists my nurture<br>
            How a season shapes a garden<br>
            How the weeds just await my neglect<br><br>
            The garden of our lives past was barren<br>
            And all of the bulbs with potential, uprooted<br>
            The summer sun oppressive<br>
            No river for irrigation<br>
            And it was in a rural plot<br>
            Somewhere where no one listens<br>
            To a gardener in anguish<br><br>

            There is so much I could teach you<br>
            If you come sit next to me in the mulch<br>
            Your overalls already dirty<br>
            The bug bites already lining your ankles<br>
            I will show you how to garden<br><br>
